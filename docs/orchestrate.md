# bonfyre-orchestrate

`bonfyre-orchestrate` is a machine-only planner for Bonfyre. It is not a chat UI and it does not expose human prompting to the end user.

## Goals

- Keep Bonfyre fully usable without a model
- Add an optional planner that can choose higher-leverage Bonfyre blocks automatically
- Use strict structured JSON and a hidden system contract
- Respect latency so the orchestrator boosts the system instead of slowing it down

## Why Gemma 4

Google introduced Gemma 4 on April 2, 2026 as a new open model family aimed at advanced reasoning and agentic workflows, with native function-calling, structured JSON output, and system instructions.

## Runtime model

Bonfyre uses three layers here:

1. Deterministic Bonfyre baseline
2. `bonfyre-orchestrate` heuristic planner
3. Optional Gemma 4 assist over an OpenAI-compatible endpoint

If no endpoint is configured, `bonfyre-orchestrate` still produces a valid boost plan from Bonfyre's operator registry and the request contract.

## Commands

```bash
bonfyre-orchestrate status
bonfyre-orchestrate surfaces --json
bonfyre-orchestrate template audio
bonfyre-orchestrate plan request.json
```

## Environment

```bash
export BONFYRE_ORCHESTRATE_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions
export BONFYRE_ORCHESTRATE_MODEL=google/gemma-4-E4B
export BONFYRE_ORCHESTRATE_API_KEY=...
```

## Request contract

```json
{
  "input_type": "audio",
  "objective": "publishable-multi-output",
  "latency_class": "interactive",
  "surface": "pages+jobs",
  "artifact_path": "site/demos/input/example"
}
```

## Output contract

```json
{
  "mode": "gemma4-assisted",
  "model": "google/gemma-4-E4B",
  "selected_binaries": ["bonfyre-ingest", "bonfyre-media-prep", "bonfyre-transcribe", "bonfyre-brief"],
  "booster_binaries": ["bonfyre-narrate", "bonfyre-render", "bonfyre-emit", "bonfyre-pack"],
  "control_surfaces": ["bonfyre-render", "bonfyre-emit", "bonfyre-queue"],
  "expected_outputs": ["normalized-audio", "transcript", "brief", "rendered-output", "formatted-output"]
}
```

## Design constraints

- No end-user prompt text
- No replacement of core deterministic Bonfyre operators
- Optional boost path only
- Registry-bounded: only known Bonfyre operators can be selected
- Low-latency aware: interactive flows get fewer always-on stages and more optional boosters

## Control profile

Bonfyre derives a control profile for each operator from the typed registry. The orchestrator now scores plans over:

- `cost`
- `latency`
- `confidence`
- `reversibility`
- `utility`
- `information_gain`

This is the bridge from theory to runtime:

- information theory: call the model only when expected information gain is meaningful
- control theory: optimize a bounded plan under latency and stability constraints
- rate-distortion: trade compute against realization quality instead of generating freeform output

## Policy memory

The orchestrator keeps a compact SQLite policy store keyed by:

- `input_type`
- `objective`
- `latency_class`
- `surface`

That means Bonfyre can reuse winning boost sets without calling the model again for the same orchestration signature.

Gemma is gated by the current plan itself:

- low expected information gain: skip the model
- already-high confidence: skip the model
- known policy signature: reuse cached booster set first

## Feedback and regret

Bonfyre can now record simple post-run feedback:

```bash
bonfyre-orchestrate feedback request.json 0.22 0.08
```

Meaning:

- `0.22` = observed quality gain
- `0.08` = observed latency delta

The orchestrator stores:

- average quality gain
- average latency delta
- average regret
- sample count

This is the first thin evaluation loop needed for policy distillation and long-run adaptive control.
